# Components

This library is intended to be used in a composable fashion. Therefore you will find yourself using nested components to build your map rather than just a complicated inline format.

The main mapping component is `GoogleMap`, however the following components are available at your disposal:

- [Marker](./marker.md)
- [Polyline](./polyline.md)
- [Polygon](./polygon.md)
- [Rectangle](./rectangle.md)
- [Circle](./circle.md)
- [Info Window](./info-window.md)
- [Custom Marker](./custom-marker.md)
- [Custom Control](./custom-control.md)
- [Marker Cluster](./marker-cluster.md)
- [Heatmap Layer](./heatmap-layer.md)
